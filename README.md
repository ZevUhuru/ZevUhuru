# Hi and Welcome, I'm Zev 🥷🏽💻

<!-- A born and raised NYC dev from Queens, I recently moved to Miami, FL with my wife and 1-year-old daughter to escape the cold winters but am now missing out on all of the great NYC food options :(, it's okay, the doordash bill is now manageable and my wife is an excellent chef!! :p -->

I design and ship agentic workflows; multi-model orchestration, template-driven pipelines, and structured output systems. [**Esy.com**][EsyHome] (Eh-see) is my primary case study: a production platform I built from zero, documented at [research.esy.com][EsyResearch], with courses on applied AI tooling at [esy.com/courses][EsyCourses].

## Corporate Portfolio
- [fubosportsnetwork.com][FSNHome] - ***I developed fuboTV's homegrown sports network streaming site from scratch using GatsbyJS***
- [fubo.tv/news][FuboNews] - ***I developed and launched fuboTV News using Ghost CMS from scratch***
- [ir.fubo.tv][FuboIR] - ***I selected and managed the 3rd party development company and coordinated fuboTV's C-Level executives and other stakeholders to launch ir.fubo.tv from scratch.***
- [SellUsYourCar.com][SUYC] - ***Previously, a fully standalone multi-route SPA purposed lead generator onboarded and prompted users for vehicle information to quote and sell their cars to https://www.vroom.com/sell*** (deprecated) 
## Applied Research



- [esy.com][EsyHome] - ***Multi-model orchestration layer for academic research. Template-driven workflows route user queries through citation-first pipelines to produce structured, publish-ready output.***
- [clip.art][ClipArtHome] - ***The web's largest AI-generated clip art library. Built with batch processing pipelines, prompt engineering, and scalable content taxonomy systems.*** 
<!-- - [wordtoken.com][WordTokenHome] - ***Compare the pricing by 'word tokens' of popular LLM's*** -->
